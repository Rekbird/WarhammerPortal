        body: "Welcome to the rules section of Warhammer 40,000 – a guide to playing games in the war-torn galaxy of the Dark Millennium. As well as including the core rules for engaging in tabletop warfare with your miniatures, this section is packed with different ways to enjoy games of Warhammer 40,000, crammed with inspiration and brimming with battles. Throughout the following pages you’ll find an array of different rules and guidelines to suit all hobbyists, from casual collectors who play occasional games with their friends, to veteran warriors who’ve spent years honing their forces for competitive tournaments. The core rules are everybody’s starting point, but as everyone enjoys the Games Workshop hobby in different ways, this section of the book also introduces three different ways to approach your games: open play, narrative play, and matched play. Each offers a different experience but it’s important to note that elements of each can be mixed and matched to create whatever kind of gaming experience you want – they are a gaming toolbox, providing inspiration and options to get the dice rolling and allow you to play with your collection of Citadel Miniatures on the tabletop. You will also find a guide to building battlefields, the rules for forming a Battle-forged army, and an introduction to advanced rules, which explore additional ways to fight your battles. So whether you are looking to wage war in one of the myriad deadly environments of the galaxy, play a team game, or fight battles as part of an escalating narrative campaign, there is an expansion to enable you to do so. A universe of war awaits you – read on to see short explanations of what you will find on these pages and how to use them in your games, starting with the essential core rules.",
